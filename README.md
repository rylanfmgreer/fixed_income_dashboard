# fixed_income_dashboard

Nothing fancy here. This reads a treausury yield curve, 
calculates the principal components, and does some
basic analytics on the curve/those components.

I'm trying to learn basic strategies so this also outputs
some very rudimentary trades (such as:
if the level rises x units, it checks for what the level
typically does the next day if it rises around x units, 
and outputs the average move over the next day given today's move.)

Again, nothing fancy -- this is more of a project
that I undertook for my own learning, rather than to
really revolutionize the world.
